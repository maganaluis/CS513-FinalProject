# Data Cleaning Project

## Usage: 
To replicate the Data Cleaning workflow you can open the jupyter notebook, and run all cells. The notebook uses standard anaconda packages to clean the data, so given that you have an Python Anaconda distribution, you should be able to run it. The notebook will create farmers.db which you can load into sqlite3 and this should contain the clean Farmers dataset.

For more information in the data cleaning workflow you can go trough the notebook preview which explains all steps. To get a information on this assesment you can read the *InitialAssesment.pdf* provided in the repository.

The python file **workflow.py** it is also provided to create *CleanFarmers.csv* directly, and this can be run with in the command line but will not generate the YesWorkFlow graph, to create this you'll need to follow the YesWorkFlow instructions: https://github.com/yesworkflow-org/yw-prototypes

## Requirements: 
- Python 3.7 (Anaconda Distribution)
- YesWorkFlow Binaries
