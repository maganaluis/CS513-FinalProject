# CS513-FinalProject

## Usage: 
To replicate the Data Cleaning workflow you can open the jupyter notebook, and run all cells. The notebook only uses Pandas and Numpy to clean the data, so given that you have an Python Anaconda distribution, you should be able to run it. The notebook will create farmers.db which you can load into sqlite3 and this should contain the clean Farmers dataset.

A python file it is also provided to create "CleanFarmers.csv", this can be run with python in the command line but will not generate the YesWorkFlow graph, to create it you'll need to follow YesWorkFlow instructions: https://github.com/yesworkflow-org/yw-prototypes

## Requirements: 
- Python 3.7 (Anaconda Distribution)
- YesWorkFlow Binaries
